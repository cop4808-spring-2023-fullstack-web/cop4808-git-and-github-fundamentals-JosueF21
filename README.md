Adding GIF file showing the implementation of the four newly created functions in the calculator Square Root, Log, Cosine, and Tangent in the readme.md files.

I first began by adding a new row of buttons. This was done by editing the style.css file. After completing this change I added a new row that appeared in the calculator, I filled this new row with four equally sized buttons. After creating the four new buttons in the calculatorindex.html I changed its color to red in oder to differentiate with the orignal buttons. I also added bold text to the buttons and active color whenever the buttons were clicked as well. After completing the visual aspect of it I changed the Javascript code in order to add the four newly created functions which I have already mentioned.I was now able to conduct four new math operations with this calculator. I hope everyone can enjoy this Calculator !!!!
